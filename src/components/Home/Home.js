        I am a <span className="Bolding">third year</span> programming student at Tampere University of Applied
        Sciences (TAMK) where I am currently specializing in the software development department.
        I began coding back in the early 2010s when Drupal was cool and haven't stopped since.
        I have tried so many things, oh god you would not believe me!
      </p>
      <p>
        I have tested everything from web to mobile to games. And oh boy what a journey has it been!
